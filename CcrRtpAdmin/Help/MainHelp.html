      <p class="main"> This 'Cork Campus Radio RTP Admin' is a Java based Real 
        Transport Protocol receiver, exporter and database administration application 
        developed to be used by the members/employees of the college radio station 
        'Cork Campus Radio' (CCR). It is basically an administration version of 
        the 'Cork Campus Radio RTP Client' application developed for listeners 
        of CCR as opposed to members of staff of the radio station. </p>
      <p class="main">The Real Transport Protocol is:</p>
      <p align="center" class="main"><em>&quot;The Internet-standard protocol 
        for the transport of real-time data, including audio and video. RTP is 
        used in virtually all voice-over-IP architectures, for videoconferencing, 
        media-on-demand, and other applications. A thin protocol, it supports 
        content identification, timing reconstruction, and detection of lost packets.</em>&quot;</p>

      <p align="center" class="main">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="main">The 'Cork Campus Radio RTP Client' (CCR RTP Admin), allows 
        the user to listen to an RTP stream that is broadcast across over a network, 
        (the internet, college intranet). Besides enabling the user to listen 
        to the college radio station, my application will also allow the user 
        to view an up to date schedule of the station&#8217;s programmes for the 
        current day, or view the schedules for any other day of the week, while 
        listening to the station&#8217;s programmes. </p>
      <p class="main"><br>
        Should the user wish to listen to an 'RTP' steam other than that of the 
        &#8216;Cork Campus Radio&#8217;, my application will provide an interface 
        where they can enter their own parameters and listen to a 'user-specified' 
        RTP stream. The application implements a &#8216;RTP Session History&#8217; 
        list which keeps track of any steams which have been listened to in a 
        particular session, so the user does not have to re-enter details of any 
        session already listened to. I have also incorporated an audio file player 
        into the &#8216;CCR RTP Client&#8217;. This player allows the user to 
        listen to an audio file(s) such as an &#8216;MP3&#8217; and 'WAV' file 
        formats</p>
      <p class="main">The application, the &#8216;Cork Campus Radio RTP Admin&#8217; 
        (CCR RTP Admin), allows the radio station to update the stations programme 
        schedule through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and view 
        the schedule for any day of the week. The radio station administrator 
        can also record a live stream from their live RTP transmission, allowing 
        them to easily save programmes in &#8216;MP3&#8217; or &#8216;WAV&#8217; 
        audio file formats. </p>
